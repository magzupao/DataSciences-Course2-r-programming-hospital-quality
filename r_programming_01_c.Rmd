## Objective  
Report quality of care at more than 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the US This data set essentially covers all major hospitals in the United States.  


## Introduction  
To make the report we will use three data files:
• Care outcome measures.csv: Contains information on 30-day mortality and readmission rates for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for more than 4,000 hospitals.
• hospital-data.csv: Contains information about each hospital.
• Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf: Descriptions of the variables of each file (ie the codebook).  
  
A description of the variables in each of the files is found in the included PDF file named Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf.   

This document contains information about many other files that are not included with this schedule assignment. You will want to focus on the variables for Number 19 ("Outcome of Care Measures.csv") and Number 11 ("Hospital Data.csv"). It may be helpful to print this document (at least the pages for Tables 19 and 11) to have at your side while working on this assignment. In particular, the number of variables in each table indicates column indices in each table (ie "Hospital Name" is column 2 in the table of outcome-of-care-measures.csv).  
  

## Development process:  
  
1.	Setting up a working environment

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# we will use the RStudio IDE
#setwd(“create a work folder”)

getwd()

if ( !file.exists("rprog_data_ProgAssignment3-data.zip")) {
  url.file<-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fdata%2FProgAssignment3-data.zip"
  file.zip<-"rprog_data_ProgAssignment3-data.zip"
  download.file(url.file, file.zip)
  unzip(file.zip)
}

list.files()

```
  
2.	We explore the data  
To view the content, format and perform tests.  
```{r, echo=TRUE}  
# load the contents of the file into the variable file.temp.
data <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
#column numbers
ncol(data)
#numbers of rows
nrow(data)
#we show the columns that we are going to use
head(data[,c(2,7,11)])
```
  
3. Analisamos los datos  

3.1.  Plot the 30-day mortality rates for heart attack  
  
The following code, gives a response from the best hospital to attend a heart attack.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

rankall <- function() {
  
  ## load state
  validState = sort(unique(data[,7]))
  
  data_column <- 11	## Column name = Hospital 30-Day Death (Mortality) Rates from Heart Attack
  
  hospital<-character(0)
  
  for (i in seq_along(validState)) {
    ## Return hospital name in that state with the given rank 30-day death rate
    newdata <- data[data$State==validState[i],]
    # order data by outcome
    newdatasorted <- newdata[order(suppressWarnings(as.numeric(newdata[,data_column])),newdata[["Hospital.Name"]],decreasing=FALSE,na.last=NA), ]
    # best hospital = 1
    hospital[i] <- newdatasorted[1,"Hospital.Name"]
  }
  ## Return a data frame with the hospital names and the (abbreviated) state name
  data.frame(hospital=hospital,state=validState,row.names=validState)	
  
}

head(rankall())
```
  
3.2 Finding the best hospital in a state  
  
Write a function called best that take two arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state and an outcome name.

Example, best("NY", "heart attack")

```{r, echo=TRUE}

best <- function(state, outcome) {

  ## read file
  data <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
  
  ## Check outcome
  validOutcome = c("heart attack","heart failure","pneumonia")
  if (!outcome %in% validOutcome) { 
    stop("invalid outcome")
  }
  
  ## Check state - we saved to declare a variable
  if (!state %in% data[,7]){
    stop("invalid state")
  }
  
  if (outcome == "heart attack") {
    data_column <- 11	## Column name = Hospital 30-Day Death (Mortality) Rates from Heart Attack
  }
  else if (outcome == "heart failure") {
    data_column <- 17	## Column name = Hospital 30-Day Death (Mortality) Rates from Heart Failure
  }	
  
  newdata <- data[data$State==state,]
  idRegistro <- which.min(suppressWarnings(as.double(newdata[,data_column])))
  ## suppressWarnings
  ## not print
  ## Warning message: NAs introduced by coercion 
  newdata[idRegistro,"Hospital.Name"]	
  
}

best("NY", "heart attack")

```

3.3 Ranking hospitals by outcome in a state  
  
Write a function called rankhospital that takes three arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state (state), an outcome (outcome), and the ranking of a hospital in that state for that outcome (num).  
The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the ranking specified by the num argument.  
  
For example, the call rankhospital("MD", "heart failure", 5)  

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rankhospital <- function(state, outcome, num = "best") {
  
  ## read file
  data <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
  
  ## Check outcome
  validOutcome = c("heart attack","heart failure","pneumonia")
  if (!outcome %in% validOutcome) { 
    stop("invalid outcome")
  }
  
  ## Check state - we saved to declare a variable
  if (!state %in% data[,7]){
    stop("invalid state")
  }
  
  if (outcome == "heart attack") {
    data_column <- 11	## Column name = Hospital 30-Day Death (Mortality) Rates from Heart Attack
  }
  else if (outcome == "heart failure") {
    data_column <- 17	## Column name = Hospital 30-Day Death (Mortality) Rates from Heart Failure
  }
  else {
    data_column <- 23	## Column name = Hospital 30-Day Death (Mortality) Rates from Pneumonia
  }	
  
  newdata <- data[data$State==state,]	
  newdatasorted <- newdata[order( suppressWarnings(as.numeric(newdata[,data_column])),newdata["Hospital.Name"],decreasing=FALSE,na.last=NA), ]
  ## suppressWarnings
  ## not print
  ## Warning message: NAs introduced by coercion 
  
  if (num=="best"){
    num = 1
  }
  if (num=='worst'){
    num = nrow(newdatasorted)
  }
  
  newdatasorted[num,"Hospital.Name"]
}

rankhospital("MD", "heart failure", 5)
```
